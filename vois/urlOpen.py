def urlOpen(url, output, target='_blank'):

    Opean a web page in another tab of the browser
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    url : str
        URL of the page to open
    output : instance of ipywidgets.Output() class
        Output widget where the javascript code to open the new page is executed
    target : str, optional
        Target of the open operation (default is '_blank' which means that the page will be opened in a new browser's tab)
        
    Example
    -------
    Open Google page in another tab of the browser::
    
        from vois import urlOpen
        from ipywidgets import widgets, Layout
        from IPython.display import display

        output = widgets.Output(layout=Layout(width='0px', height='0px'))
        display(output)
        
        urlOpen.urlOpen('https://www.google.com', output, target='_blank')
    
        
    Note
    ----
        If the dashboard is created using the :class:`app.app` class, it is preferable to use the function :func:`app.app.urlOpen` that doesn't need the output parameter and uses the Output widget created inside the app instance itself (and invisible to the users)
