def downloadText(textobj, fileName="download.txt"):
    """
    Download of a string as a text file.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
        textobj : str
            Text to be written in the text file to be downloaded
        fileName : str, optional
            Name of the file to download (default is "download.txt")
            
    Example
    -------
    In order to download a text file, the Output widget download.output must be displayed inside the notebook. This is required because the download operation is based on the execution of Javascript code, and this requires an Output widget displayed. After the download.output widget is visible, then the download.downloadText function can be called::
    
        from vois import download
        
        display(download.output)
        
        with download.output:
            download.downloadText('aaa bbb ccc')
