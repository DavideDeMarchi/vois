# Created following this tutorial: https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/
#
# This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
# package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
# users can install this project, e.g.:
#
# $ pip install sampleproject
#
# And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
#
# There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
# specification here:
# https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name
name = "vois"  # Required

# Versions should comply with PEP 440:
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
#
# For a discussion on single-sourcing the version, see
# https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/
version = "1.0.21"  # Required

# This is a one-line description or tagline of what your project does. This
# corresponds to the "Summary" metadata field:
# https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#summary
description = "A Python Voilà simplification library"  # Optional

# This is an optional longer description of your project that represents
# the body of text which users will see when they visit PyPI.
#
# Often, this is the same as your README, so you can just read it in from
# that file directly (as we have already done above)
#
# This field corresponds to the "Description" metadata field:
# https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#description-optional
readme = "README.md" # Optional

# Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
# 'Programming Language' classifiers above, 'pip install' will check this
# and refuse to install the project if the version does not match. See
# https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#python-requires
requires-python = ">=3.7"

# This is either text indicating the license for the distribution, or a file
# that contains the license
# https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#license
license = {file = "LICENCE"}

# This field adds keywords for your project which will appear on the
# project page. What does your project relate to?
#
# Note that this is a list of additional keywords, separated
# by commas, to be used to assist searching for the distribution in a
# larger catalog.
keywords = ["Voilà", "dashboards", "setuptools", "development"]  # Optional

# This should be your name or the name of the organization who originally
# authored the project, and a valid email address corresponding to the name
# listed.

# listed.

# Classifiers help users find your project by categorizing it.
#
# For a list of valid classifiers, see https://pypi.org/classifiers/
classifiers = [  # Optional
  # How mature is this project? Common values are
  #   3 - Alpha
  #   4 - Beta
  #   5 - Production/Stable
  "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",

  # Indicate who your project is intended for
  "Intended Audience :: Developers",
  "Topic :: Software Development :: Build Tools",

  # Pick your license as you wish
  "License :: OSI Approved :: European Union Public Licence 1.2 (EUPL 1.2)",

  # Specify the Python versions you support here. In particular, ensure
  # that you indicate you support Python 3. These classifiers are *not*
  # checked by "pip install". See instead "python_requires" below.

# This field lists other packages that your project depends on to run.
# Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your project is
