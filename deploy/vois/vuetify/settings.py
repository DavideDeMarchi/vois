dark_mode = False            # If False then the foreground color is 'black', otherwise it is 'white'
"""
Flag to control the dark_mode of all the vuetify widgets.

If this flag is False, the foreground color used for text is 'black, otherwise it is 'white'
"""


button_rounded = True             # If True the buttons have rounded borders
"""
Flag to control the appearance of all button widgets (also in the toggle module or inside the title and footer bars).

If True, the buttons will have rounded borders, if False, the buttons will have squared borders. 

The :py:class:`button.button` class has an optional parameter **rounded** that can be used to force a single button to be rounded or squared. This setting will have influence on all the buttons created without expliciting setting the **rounded** parameter. 

Example of changing the appearance of all buttons to be rounded::

    from vois.vuetify import settings, button
    settings.button_rounded = True

    import importlib
    importlib.reload(button)

    b = button.button('Round button', width=200, selected=True)
    display(b.draw())

.. figure:: figures/RoundButton.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: RoundButton

   Example of a round button


Example of changing the appearance of all buttons to be squared::

    from vois.vuetify import settings, button
    settings.button_rounded = False

    import importlib
    importlib.reload(button)

    b = button.button('Squared button', width=200, selected=True)
    display(b.draw())

.. figure:: figures/SquaredButton.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: RoundButton

   Example of a squared button

.. note::

    The usage of **importlib.reload** is needed to reload the button module after the settings.button_rounded flag is changed
